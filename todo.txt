Refactor classes so they are easy to test. Use interfaces where appropriate to allow dependency injection.
Get rid of the logging service we have right now. It's not working and unnecessary for the purposes of this program.

Export function?

Testing plan:

	----------------------
	Scrape/Parse tests:  |
	==============================================================
	+ Pass bad search terms (URL string too long, etc.). Try to break URL encode.
	+ Full page of results
	+ Partial page of results
	+ Result page with no results

	+ Result item with "broken" (not catchable via regex) data.
		One for each piece of data being collected

	+ Result page with "broken" result count + 
		any other page-level values being extracted

	--------------------------
	Data type / value tests:  |
	=================================================================
	+ Validate numeric range and its subclasses (doublerange, intrange)
		Try to create an instance of type "double" AND "Double" (value/reference)

	----------------
	Control tests: |
	=================================================================
